# DeepLearingFinalProject
Deep learning model on Audience Dataset to estimate age range

# Image Classification Project

## Introduction
This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The CNN model includes several convolutional, pooling, and dense layers and also uses several tricks including dropout and early stopping. Data
argumentation is also used. The target of this model is to ouput the age range of certain person.


## Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the project environment:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    refer to requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Below are the instructions on how to use this project:

Run the finalproj.ipynb to train the model.

Use 100epoch.keras to load the model and then you can test the model in the testloader.

Hyperparameters can be changed for further study.
